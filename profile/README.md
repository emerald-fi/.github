# Emerald
Let opportunity come to you.

## Mission
Emerald is an Open Source Product Stack focused on making the Web3 experience intuitive and approachable.

Our objective is to help users "get more done, in less time" using decentralized technologies and protocols.

We priotize simplicity, experimentation and meeting users where they are, instead of where we want them to be.

Staying open to the question "What's possible?" and striving to find the perfect balance between what's technologically interesting and also what makes a great product. 

## Contribute
As an Open Source Product Stack we welcome all contributors. Our shared goal is to build a world-class onchain experience that helps users complete high-impact actions.
